📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard 📦

This project was developed during my internship to analyze E-commerce sales data using Power BI.
The goal was to help business owners and decision-makers quickly understand:

✅ Best-selling products
✅ Sales trends (monthly/seasonal peaks)
✅ Revenue contribution by categories and regions
✅ Top customers by sales
The dashboard provides interactive filters (by year, month, region, category, etc.) and helps in data-driven decision-making.
